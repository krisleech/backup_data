Database Backup Plugin
======================

Engine style plugin which allow a user (usually admin) to manually backup the database and files themselves. 

It uses the connection details in database.yml.

Create a routes like so:

map.admin_backup_database '/admin/backup/database', :controller => 'admin/backups', :action => 'database'
map.admin_backup_files '/admin/backup/files', :controller => 'admin/backups', :action => 'files'
map.admin_backup '/admin/backup', :controller => 'admin/backups'

The Admin::BackupsController inherits from Admin::AdminController, this may not fit with your app.

However if you install this as a plugin this is easily changed.
